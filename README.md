# Investigating Automated Level Design

This project investigates multiple automation techniques for level design through the implementation of various prototypes. The types of techniques are influenced by art, narrative structure and other non-game forms of media, as well as taking inspiration from game related level design theory and academic research. The project finds that these techniques, when used to structure levels, are a powerful tool for learning and searched based level automation.

### Markov Chain Tile-Based Level Generator
This prototype uses a Markov Chain to learn the probability between tiles in pre-made, 3D levels. As seen in the video linked below these learned probabilities are used to generate new permutations of the learned level.

### Unity Prototypes
This repository contains the Unity Project in which all prototypes were developed. These projects are discussed and showcased in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlCWWixwgvA) above and include investigations into;

The Hero's Journey/ Parse Trees in 3D Space
The Four Colour Theorem
Poetry and Song Structure
Piet Mondrian Influenced Level Parsing
Using Heights and Change in Height as Input
