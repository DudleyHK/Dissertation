This project investigates multiple automation techniques for level design through the implementation of various prototypes. The types of techniques are influenced by art, narrative structure and other non-game forms of media, as well as taking inspiration from game related level design theory and academic research. The project finds that these techniques, when used to structure levels, are a powerful tool for learning and searched based level automation.
