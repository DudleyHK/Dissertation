# Investigating Automated Level Design

This project investigates multiple automation techniques for level design through the implementation of various prototypes. The types of techniques are influenced by art, narrative structure and other non-game forms of media, as well as taking inspiration from game related level design theory and academic research. The project finds that these techniques, when used to structure levels, are a powerful tool for learning and searched based level automation.
