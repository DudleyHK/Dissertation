# Investigating Automated Level Design

This project investigates multiple automation techniques for level design through the implementation of various prototypes. The types of techniques are influenced by art, narrative structure and other non-game forms of media, as well as taking inspiration from game related level design theory and academic research. The project finds that these techniques, when used to structure levels, are a powerful tool for learning and searched based level automation.

## C++ Console Prototypes Investigations
Prior to developing Prototypes in Unity I developed console based applications to test ideas researched in the early stage of this project. This provided a fast way to understand and visualise concepts befofe managing assets in the Unity environment.


### Sentence Generator
The Sentence Generator aims to investigate how parse tree can be used for level automation. This prototype proved that parse tree's could be successfully used to procedurally generate a sentence where each *string* has the potencial to replaced with a more complex data type.

### Markov Number Generator
The Markov Number Generator was developed when first learning about Markov Chain's. The intention of this prototype was to help visualise how the underlying system would function in a Unity 3D environment to help with the development of the *Markov Chain Tile-Based Level Generator*.

## Unity Prototype Investigations
This repository contains the Unity Project in which all prototypes were developed. These projects are discussed and showcased in the [Final Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlCWWixwgvA) and include investigations into the techniques below.


### The Hero's Journey
This prototype aims to automate the level design process by using the parse tree technique and the narrative structure The Hero’s Journey.

### The Four Colour Theorem
This prototype looks at level design automation for exploration based game genres such as Rogue-likes along with world overviews and layouts such as the New Mario Bros (Nintendo EAD) world lobby view.

### Poetry and Song Structure
Song structure typically used in Pop-Music, takes advantage of a *Bridge* to break the pattern of a song. Likewise, Iambic Pentameter, found in poetic writing, uses off beats to break the pattern. Breaking patterns is a technique currently adopted in Game Level Design to create memorable experiences. The Rhythm Based Platformer prototype was implemented to test this research.

### Shapes
Inspired by Piet Mondrian’s piece, *Composition II in Red, Blue and Yellow* and the main issues with the *Markov Chain Tile-Based Level Generator* prototype. This prototype aims to learn the individual features in a level instead of individual tiles.

### Height and Deltas
This prototype aims to automate the level design process by learning from levels in which each

## Markov Chain Tile-Based Level Generator
This prototype uses a Markov Chain to learn the probability between tiles in pre-made, 3D levels. As seen in the video linked below these learned probabilities are used to generate new permutations of the learned level.
